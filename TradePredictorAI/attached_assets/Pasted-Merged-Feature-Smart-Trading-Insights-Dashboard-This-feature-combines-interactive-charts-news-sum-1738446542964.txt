Feature Name: Smart Trading Insights Dashboard

Objective:
Provide users with a comprehensive trading assistant that combines real-time charting, news aggregation, and behavioral insights to enhance decision-making and trading performance.

Key Components:

Advanced Charting and Technical Analysis:
Integrate interactive charts with popular technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).
Allow users to customize charts and set alerts for specific price levels or indicator thresholds.
Example: "Here’s a chart for Tesla with RSI indicating it’s oversold. Would you like to buy?"
News Aggregation and Summarization:
Aggregate financial news from multiple sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC).
Use NLP to summarize news articles and highlight key points relevant to the user’s portfolio or watchlist.
Example: "Here’s a summary of today’s top financial news: [key points]."
Behavioral Finance Insights:
Analyze user behavior (e.g., frequent selling of winning stocks, overtrading) to identify biases.
Provide personalized advice to help users make more rational trading decisions.
Example: "You tend to sell winning stocks too early. Consider holding them longer for higher returns."
User Flow:

User Query:
The user asks the chatbot for insights on a specific stock or market trend.
Example: "What’s the outlook for Tesla?"
Smart Insights Dashboard:
The chatbot responds with an interactive chart showing Tesla’s price movement and key technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).
It provides a news summary highlighting recent developments affecting Tesla (e.g., earnings reports, Elon Musk’s tweets).
It offers behavioral insights based on the user’s trading history (e.g., "You’ve sold Tesla shares prematurely in the past. Consider holding longer this time.").
Actionable Recommendations:
The chatbot suggests potential actions (e.g., "Tesla is oversold. Would you like to buy?").
It also provides a risk assessment (e.g., "This trade aligns with your risk tolerance.").
Implementation Steps:

Integrate Charting Libraries:
Use libraries like Chart.js, Plotly, or TradingView’s Lightweight Charts to embed interactive charts in the chatbot interface.
Example: Display a candlestick chart with RSI and MACD indicators.
News Aggregation API:
Use APIs like NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage News, or Google News API to fetch financial news.
Use NLP models (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT, Hugging Face) to summarize news articles.
Behavioral Analysis Engine:
Analyze user trading history to identify patterns (e.g., overtrading, loss aversion).
Use behavioral finance frameworks (e.g., prospect theory) to provide personalized advice.
Unified Interface:
Design a clean, user-friendly interface that displays charts, news summaries, and behavioral insights in a single view.
Example: A carousel format where users can swipe between charts, news, and insights.
Example User Interaction:
